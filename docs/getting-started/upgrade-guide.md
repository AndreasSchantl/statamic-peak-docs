# Upgrade Guide

## Statamic 3.4 to 4.0
With the Release of Peak 12 and Statamic 4.0 the Peak addons got updated to the following major versions:

* Commands 2.0
* SEO 2.0
* Browser Appearance 2.0
* Tools 3.0

If you intent to install these you're going to have to do some manual changes to your blueprints to support sections and import the correct fieldsets from the addons. The changes are listed in these [Release Notes](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak/releases/tag/v12.0). Only [this PR](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak/pull/314) is required. Other updates are optional.
