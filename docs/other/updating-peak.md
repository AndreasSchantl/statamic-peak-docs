# Updating Peak

Since this is a Starter Kit and you usually edit all kinds of files in it, updating Peak **cannot be automated**. That means if you want to use the latest Peak features you have to skim through the [changelog](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and manually copy over the bits you want to use in your older projects.

All relevant PR's and commits are listed in the changelog so it should be pretty straight forward to find out what files you need to change.
